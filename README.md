IMDB is a dataset containing information about movies (international) and TV episodes from their beginnings. 
The information includes movie titles, directors, actors, genre, and year produced/started. Some rating information is also included. 
The same is true for TV episodes and includes number of seasons in terms of start and end years as well as episodes in each season. 
It is quite large and should not require additional information to understand the data set. 
The data of this database that you will use is given below.
